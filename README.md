CHAPTER- 1 INTRODUCTION TO THE PROJECT
1.1.	Introduction of Food Application
An online food ordering system is proposed here which simplifies the food ordering process. It can be defined as a simple and convenient way for customers to order food online, without having to go to the restaurant. The proposed system shows a customer interface and updates the menu with all available options so that it eases the customer work. Customers can choose more than one item to make an order and can view order details.
Our food application aims to provide users with a seamless and intuitive platform for communication, leveraging the power of modern web technologies. Built using the MERN stack – MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js – our application combines the robustness of a backend server with the responsiveness of a frontend user interface, offering a comprehensive solution for real-time messaging.

The MERN stack is becoming more and more well-liked in the front-end and back-end web development space. The reason for using React is that it was developed using JavaScript, which has been the most widely used programming language among developers for more than 25 years. Facebook developers designed React on top of JS, which made creating the user interface (UI) far easier than with standard HTML. It greatly sped up and simplified the process of rendering the components. For example, we had to hardcode a component as many times as we needed it if we
needed to render it repeatedly. With React, on the other hand, we just need to create a component once.

MERN stack uses Express JS and Node JS for developing the backend. Earlier, the entire backend client and server part used to be handled by solely Node. However, sending requests and getting back responses from the server was so much more difficult, tedious, painstaking and more complicated. Then, Express was introduced as the de facto application server for building backend API. The server and client applications were made so much easier as there was no need to build the server but it was introduced by Express itself. Using Express has become as easy as importing it in
 
a backend file and creating its instance using the const app = require(‘express’) and then listening to it on a given port number just like the backend. The syntax becomes much simpler with Express than using simple Node. Also, the react-router-Dom provides us with the Router functionality that helps us define routes in the frontend application without creating a backend directory for the routing part. The router consists of the routing endpoint and the handler function for the request handling portion.

The fourth pillar of the MERN stack is the Node JS framework which has been discussed before with the Express framework. Node JS revolutionized the running of JavaScript outside of a web browser. Earlier, it could only be run on the web browser and not in the local run-time environment. Now, it has become easier to run JavaScript in the local terminal. Since it is not a multi-threaded language, JavaScript has the concept of promises and callbacks to run code asynchronously and NodeJS allows us to do that. The async await syntax allows us to run code asynchronously and has been an improvement over the normal promises and callbacks. Also, async await code makes the code look as though it is synchronous.

This is because it leads to a very common problem in JavaScript called the callback hell. This problem makes the asynchronous code look really complicated and for someone who has been using a synchronous multi-threaded language, it can get really difficult to decode and debug it in case of errors. Hence, we use the async-await functional syntax for fetching data from the API and handling it in React templates.

React hooks and custom hooks have been used to provide code reusability in the application over the normal usual class programming. Functional components have been built and are preferred to using class components in this application. Class components are still used but the easy syntax of functional components in React makes them easier to understand and easily applicable to the
React apps.

The most primary objective of this project is to understand the concept of building applications with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React and Node). In this particular project, the focus has been built on a foodting application. The internship project focuses on developing a talking application in the MERN stack using the frontend JavaScript technology known as React and
, as well as Node JS for the backend. Google Firebase is a free backend service that keeps the user's login credentials as well as foodroom data. The admin and security permissions for
users are also prioritized in this app. Only the foodroom's administrator has the ability to change the name and description of the foodroom. The project aspires to be more than just a talking app by allowing us to submit more than just foods to the server; we can upload up to 5 files at once. In the food box, the user can choose to like or unlike certain foods. When the user likes the
 
message, a heart emoticon appears. This is feasible because of to Reacts concept of post transactions. The user can log in to the app using the Google Firebase authenticator. The unsubscribe () function also allows the user to be unsubscribed from the database when he logs out of the app. A timestamp is also provided to keep track of when the user registered into the app. The attachment icon is used to attach files to the message file, and the send button is used to transfer the files to the serve

Fig.2.1. Technology used


MERN Stack is a JavaScript Stack that is used for easier and faster deployment of full-stack web applications. MERN Stack comprises 4 technologies namely: MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js. It is designed to make the development process smoother and easier. When working with the MERN stack, developers create and implement the View layer using React Express Node is used to implement the application layer of the website then MongoDB is used to implement the database layer.
MERN stack is a collection of technologies that enables faster application development. It is used by developers worldwide. The main purpose of using the MERN stack is to develop apps using JavaScript only. This is because the four technologies that make up the technology stack are all JS-based. Thus, if one knows JavaScript (and JSON), the backend, frontend, and database can be operated easily.
The MERN stack is a popular and powerful set of technologies used for building modern web applications. Comprising MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, this stack offers a comprehensive solution for developing robust, scalable, and efficient web applications. Let's delve deeper into each component:
 
MongoDB: MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database that provides flexibility and scalability for storing and managing data. Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents, making it easy to work with dynamic schemas and hierarchical data structures. This flexibility allows developers to adapt quickly to evolving data requirements without the need for complex migrations. One of the key features of MongoDB is its scalability. It supports horizontal scaling through sharding, allowing applications to handle large volumes of data and high-traffic loads with ease.
Additionally, MongoDB's replication features ensure high availability and fault tolerance, making it suitable for mission-critical applications.
MongoDB offers several advantages that make it a popular choice for developers and organizations alike:

Express.js: Express.js is a minimal and flexible web application framework for Node.js. It provides a robust set of features for building web servers and APIs, making it an ideal choice for backend development in the MERN stack. Express.js simplifies the process of handling HTTP requests, routing, middleware integration, and error handling, allowing developers to focus on building core application logic. Express.js follows the middleware architecture, allowing developers to plug in middleware functions to handle requests and responses at various stages of the request lifecycle. This modular approach makes it easy to add features such as authentication, logging, and compression to web applications.
Express.js offers several advantages that make it a popular choice for building web applications:

•	Minimalist and Lightweight: Express.js is a minimalist web framework for Node.js, designed to be simple, unopinionated, and flexible. It provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features, allowing developers to build applications without being constrained by unnecessary abstractions or boilerplate code. Its lightweight nature makes it easy to learn, use, and extend, making it suitable for both small and large-scale projects.
 
•	Robust Middleware Support: Express.js middleware architecture allows developers to plug in middleware functions to handle various aspects of the HTTP request-response cycle. Middleware functions can perform tasks such as request parsing, authentication, authorization, logging, error handling, and response formatting. This modular approach enables developers to compose complex application logic by chaining together reusable middleware functions, promoting code reusability, modularity, and maintainability.
•	Routing: Express.js provides a powerful routing mechanism that allows developers to define routes for handling different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and URL patterns. Express.js routers enable developers to organize route handlers into modular, reusable components, making it easy to manage application routes and logic. Route parameters and pattern matching allow developers to create dynamic routes that respond to user input or URL parameters, enabling flexible and customizable behavior.
•	Template Engine Agnosticism: Express.js is agnostic to template engines, allowing developers to choose from a wide range of template engines such as EJS, Pug (formerly Jade), Handlebars, and Mustache. This flexibility enables developers to use their preferred template engine or switch between template engines based on project requirements and personal preferences. Express.js integrates seamlessly with template engines, allowing developers to render dynamic views and generate HTML responses easily.
•	Middleware Ecosystem: Express.js has a rich ecosystem of third-party middleware modules and extensions available via npm (Node.js Package Manager). These middleware modules provide additional functionality and features that extend Express.js' capabilities, such as session management, CSRF protection, compression, caching, rate limiting, and more. The vast array of middleware options allows developers to customize and enhance their Express.js applications with minimal effort, reducing development time and effort.

React.js: React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Developed by Facebook, React.js enables developers to create interactive and dynamic UI components using a declarative
 
and component-based approach. React.js simplifies the process of building complex user interfaces by breaking them down into reusable components, each encapsulating its own state and behavior. One of the key advantages of React.js is its virtual DOM (Document Object Model) implementation, which improves performance by minimizing DOM manipulation and batch updating changes. This results in faster rendering and a smoother user experience, particularly in applications with dynamic content and frequent updates. React.js also promotes code reusability and maintainability through its component-based architecture, allowing developers to compose UIs from smaller, self-contained components. This modular approach simplifies development, testing, and debugging, making it easier to scale and maintain large codebases.
React.js offers a range of advantages that contribute to its popularity among developers and organizations:
•	Component-Based Architecture: React.js is built around the concept of reusable UI components. Components encapsulate their own state and behavior, making them self- contained and independent units of functionality. This component-based architecture promotes code reusability, modularity, and maintainability, allowing developers to compose complex user interfaces from smaller, composable building blocks. Components can be easily reused across different parts of an application or shared between different projects, resulting in more efficient development and easier maintenance.
•	Virtual DOM: React.js introduces a virtual representation of the Document Object Model (DOM), known as the Virtual DOM. Instead of directly manipulating the browser's DOM, React.js reconciles changes to the virtual DOM and efficiently updates the actual DOM only where necessary. This approach minimizes DOM manipulation and reduces the number of expensive browser operations like reflows and repaints, resulting in faster rendering and improved performance, especially in applications with complex and dynamic user interfaces.
•	Declarative Syntax: React.js uses a declarative syntax to describe the desired state of the UI, rather than imperative instructions on how to change the UI. Developers specify how the UI should look based on the current state and React.js takes care of updating the DOM to reflect those changes. This declarative approach makes code more predictable, easier to understand, and less error-prone, leading to faster development and fewer bugs. It also facilitates easier debugging and maintenance, as developers can reason about the application's behavior more effectively.
 
•	Efficient Data Binding: React.js implements a unidirectional data flow, where data flows downward from parent components to child components via props. This one-way data binding ensures that changes to the parent component's state automatically propagate to its child components, triggering re-renders as necessary. React.js also supports two-way data binding through controlled components, allowing developers to build interactive forms and user interfaces with synchronized state and user input. This efficient data binding mechanism simplifies state management and reduces the risk of inconsistent UI states, enhancing the predictability and reliability of React.js applications.
•	Rich Ecosystem and Community: React.js has a thriving ecosystem of libraries, tools, and resources that complement its core functionality and support various aspects of modern web development. The React.js ecosystem includes popular libraries like Redux for state management, React Router for routing, and React Native for building native mobile applications. Additionally, React.js has a large and active community of developers, contributors, and enthusiasts who share knowledge, contribute to open-source projects, and provide support through forums, tutorials, and conferences. This vibrant community fosters collaboration, innovation, and continuous improvement, ensuring that React.js remains at the forefront of web development technology.
•	Performance Optimization: React.js offers several performance optimization techniques to improve the speed and efficiency of applications. These techniques include virtual DOM diffing, memoization, lazy loading, and code splitting, among others. By applying these optimization strategies, developers can reduce the time it takes to render and update components, minimize resource consumption, and enhance the overall responsiveness and user experience of React.js applications.
•	Overall, React.js provides a powerful and flexible framework for building modern, interactive, and scalable user interfaces. Its component-based architecture, virtual DOM, declarative syntax, efficient data binding, rich ecosystem, and performance optimization capabilities make it a preferred choice for developers seeking to create dynamic and high- performing web applications.

This approach maximizes throughput and scalability, making Node.js well- suited for building real-time, high-performance applications such as food servers, streaming platforms, and gaming servers.
•	JavaScript Everywhere: Node.js allows developers to use JavaScript for both client-side and server-side development, creating a unified development environment across the entire stack. This eliminates the need to context-switch between different programming languages and environments, streamlining the development process and promoting code reuse. Additionally, leveraging JavaScript's asynchronous programming capabilities on both the client and server sides enables developers to build highly responsive and interactive web applications with consistent code patterns and paradigms.
•	Rich Ecosystem of Packages: Node.js has a vast ecosystem of open-source packages and modules available through npm (Node.js Package Manager), the largest package registry in the world. These packages cover a wide range of functionalities, including web frameworks, utility libraries, database drivers, authentication middleware, and more. Developers can easily integrate third-party packages into their Node.js applications to add new features, accelerate development, and solve common development challenges. The availability of npm packages promotes code reuse, accelerates development, and reduces the time and effort required to build and maintain Node.js applications.
•	Scalability and Performance: Node.js is highly scalable and performs exceptionally well under high traffic and concurrent load. Its non-blocking, event-driven architecture allows it to handle thousands of simultaneous connections with low resource consumption, making it suitable for building scalable, real-time applications that require high throughput and low latency. Node.js applications can be horizontally scaled across multiple server instances or
 
distributed across a cluster of nodes, enabling seamless scaling to accommodate growing user demand and traffic spikes.
•	Community Support and Collaboration: Node.js has a vibrant and active community of developers, contributors, and enthusiasts who collaborate to improve the platform, share knowledge, and contribute to open-source projects.

CHAPTER- 3 ARCHITECTURE OF THE APPLICATION


The architecture of a food application can vary depending on factors such as scalability requirements, real-time communication needs, security considerations, and the chosen technology stack. Here's a high-level overview of a typical architecture for a food application:

Client-Side Application:

1.	User Interface (UI): The client-side application includes the user interface (UI) components responsible for displaying the Tomato Admin Panel, Add Items, List Items, and Oders. This UI is typically built using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, often with frameworks like React.js or Angular.
2.	Communication Layer: The client-side application also includes the communication layer responsible for interacting with the server-side components. This layer handles tasks such as sending and receiving oders, managing user authentication, and updating the UI in real time based on incoming data.

Server-Side Application:

1.	Web Server: The server-side application is responsible for handling incoming requests from clients, processing data, and coordinating communication between clients. It typically runs on a web server powered by a technology like Node.js with frameworks like Express.js for handling HTTP requests.
2.	Real-Time Communication: To enable real-time communication between clients, the server may utilize technologies such as WebSocket or WebRTC. WebSocket provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, allowing for efficient real-time messaging between clients and the server.
3.	Business Logic: The server-side application contains the business logic responsible for managing user authentication, cart storage, user presence, and other application-specific functionalities. It interacts with the database to retrieve and store data related to users,
 
order items, Track orders, and other application entities.
4.	Authentication and Authorization: The server handles user authentication and authorization to ensure that only authenticated users can access the food application and interact with other users. This typically involves validating user credentials, generating and verifying authentication tokens (e.g., JWT), and enforcing access control rules.
 
Database:

1.	Message Storage: Food applications often use databases to store order item data persistently. A NoSQL database like MongoDB is commonly used due to its flexibility and scalability, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of food orders, Rupees, and other application data.

External Services:

1.	Push Notification Service: To notify users about new ordersor other relevant events, the food application may integrate with a push notification service like Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or Apple Push Notification Service (APNs). These services send push notifications to users' devices, even when the food application is not actively running.
2.	Third-Party APIs: Depending on the application's requirements, it may integrate with third-party APIs for additional functionalities such as user authentication (e.g., OAuth), content moderation, translation services, and cash delivery.

Infrastructure:

1.	Load Balancer: In a distributed architecture, a load balancer distributes incoming client requests across multiple instances of the server-side application to ensure high availability and scalability.
2.	Database Replication and Sharding: To handle large volumes of data and ensure fault tolerance, the database may employ techniques such as replication and sharding. Replication creates multiple copies of the data across different servers for redundancy while sharding partitions the data into smaller chunks distributed across multiple servers.
3.	Monitoring and Logging: Monitoring and logging tools are used to track application performance, detect errors or anomalies, and troubleshoot issues. These tools provide
 
insights into system health, resource utilization, and user interactions, helping to optimize and maintain the food application.

Overall, the architecture of a food application involves client-side and server-side components working together to facilitate real-time communication, user authentication, items storage, and other key functionalities. By leveraging appropriate technologies and architectural patterns, developers can build scalable, reliable, and feature-rich food applications to meet the needs of users.

4.3	Testing:
Testing is a critical aspect of developing a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) food application to ensure its reliability, functionality, and performance. Here's a comprehensive approach to testing a MERN food application:

1.	**Unit Testing**:
-	Write unit tests for individual components, functions, and modules of the backend (Node.js/Express.js) and frontend (React.js) codebase.
-	Use testing frameworks like Jest for Node.js backend testing and tools like React Testing Library or Enzyme for React.js frontend testing.
-	Test cases should cover different scenarios, including positive and negative cases, error handling, edge cases, and boundary conditions.
-	Mock external dependencies and services (e.g., database interactions, API calls) to isolate the unit under test and ensure test repeatability and independence.

2.	**Integration Testing**:
-	Perform integration tests to validate the interactions and interoperability between different components, modules, and layers of the application.
-	Test the integration of frontend components with backend APIs, database operations, and external services.
-	Use tools like Super test for testing Express.js API endpoints and tools like Cypress for end-to-end integration testing of the entire application.

3.	**End-to-End Testing**:
-	Conduct end-to-end (E2E) tests to simulate real user interactions and scenarios within the food application.
-	Write automated test scripts to simulate user actions such as signing up, logging in, sending messages, joining food rooms, and interacting with UI elements.
-	Use testing frameworks like Cypress or Selenium for E2E testing and simulate different user workflows and scenarios to validate the functionality and usability of the application.
 
4.	**Performance Testing**:
-	Perform performance testing to assess the responsiveness, scalability, and resource utilization of the food application under various load conditions.
-	Use tools like Apache JMeter or Artillery to simulate concurrent user
connections, message traffic, and system load to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize application performance.
-	Measure metrics such as response time, throughput, latency, and resource consumption to evaluate the application's performance characteristics.

4.	**Security Testing**:
-	Conduct security testing to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities and security risks in the food application.
